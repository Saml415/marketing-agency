## Description
    This repository consists of the files required to run the website for Horiseon Social Solution Services Inc.
 The main purpose the repository was to refactor the existing code in order to make it more accessible to users specifically devs and users who use assistive technology.
 This includes providing semantic headings to each elements to help distinguive each element as well as comments that explain in familiar language what the HTML and CSS laws 
 do. There are many benefits to this form of refactoring as doing such allows webpages to receive more upvotes from search engines thus increasing web traffic.
 
## Usage 

  1. There is one folder labeled as /assets which contains the stylesheet(located via ./assets/css/style.css) and a folder that contains the image files labled images

  2. The HTML content of the webpage can be found in the index.html file in the main folder.

  3. All elements contained with in the HTML file are labled with proper semantic headings and are separated by comments based on their identity while being listed in order of 
  appearance on website.

  4. All attributes listed in the stylesheet are also listed based on order of appearance on website and are separated with comments stating the purpose of properties.
